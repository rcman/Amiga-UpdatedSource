# Amiga-Source-UpdatedSource

I've been going through my source. I realized it was full of garbage characters from my corrupting Amiga 2000 hard drive. I am in the process of cleaning them up.

The ones listed here are cleaned up. I have not looked at this code in 30+ years. Let's just say I was a noob back then. A lot of this was possible from my old friend Sean Godsell that master programmer.

Sean if you're out there buddy I'd like to hear from you.
